Or refer to it as `dplyr::filter()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(mtcars)\n#> Warning in mean.default(mtcars): argument is not numeric or logical: returning\n#> NA\n#> [1] NA\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhat it means: `mean()` works with numbers and `mtcars` is a data-frame.\n\nHow to fix it: if you want the mean of a specific column (say `wt`), try `mean(mtcars$wt)`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 2\nif (x = 2) {\n  print(\"x = 2\")\n}\n#> Error in parse(text = input): <text>:2:7: unexpected '='\n#> 1: x <- 2\n#> 2: if (x =\n#>          ^\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhat it means: R doesn't know what `if (x = 2)` means!\n\nHow to fix it: to check if `x` is 2, use `x == 2` rather than `x = 2`.\n\n\n## Files and folders\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nread.csv(\"data.csv\")\n#> Warning in file(file, \"rt\"): cannot open file 'data.csv': No such file or\n#> directory\n#> Error in file(file, \"rt\"): cannot open the connection\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhat it means: there isn't a file called `data.csv` in the folder you're working from.\n\nHow to fix it: check the name of your file is right, including the extension. Check where you're running R from with `getwd()`. You might find it helpful to use RStudio projects to make sure you're always working in the right place.\n\n\n## Packages\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(xyz)\n#> Error in library(xyz): there is no package called 'xyz'\n\nxyz::fn()\n#> Error in loadNamespace(x): there is no package called 'xyz'\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhat it means: you're trying to use a package you don't have installed, either by loading the package with `library()` or using a function from it like `stats::cov()`.\n\nHow to fix it: try installing the package with `install.packages(\"xyz\")`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(purrr)\n#> Error in install.packages : object 'purrr' not found\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhat it means: `install.packages()` is looking for an object called `purrr` to get the package name from.\n\nHow to fix it: make sure you quote the name of packages you want to install: `install.packages(\"purrr\")`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"isthisapackagename\")\n#> Installing package into 'C:/Users/dof-paulinm/Documents/R/win-library/4.4'\n#> (as 'lib' is unspecified)\n#> Warning: package 'isthisapackagename' is not available for this version of R\n#> \n#> A version of this package for your version of R might be available elsewhere,\n#> see the ideas at\n#> https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html#Installing-packages\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhat it means: there isn't a package with this name available to install.\n\nHow to fix it: check the spelling of the package name (remember they're case-sensitive). If that doesn't fix it, try searching for the package name on google to see if it's still on CRAN.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(rlang)\ninstall.packages(\"rlang\")\n#> Error in install.packages : Updating loaded packages\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhat it means: you've tried to install a package that is already in use. This could be because you've already loaded it with `library()`, or it could be a package used by RStudio.\n\nHow to fix it: try restarting R (Ctrl + Shift + F10 in RStudio) and installing the package in a fresh session. If that doesn't work, try opening R directly from the start menu and installing the package from there.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"xyz\")\n#> Warning in install.packages :\n#>  installation of package ‘xyz’ had non-zero exit status\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhat it means: `install.packages()` hasn't worked. This can happen for a few different reasons, like having more than one R session running or trying to install a package from source.\n\nHow to fix it: try `install.packages(\"xyz\", type = \"win.binary\", dependencies = TRUE)`. If that doesn't fix it, make sure you don't have any other R sessions running and try installing in a fresh R session.\n",
