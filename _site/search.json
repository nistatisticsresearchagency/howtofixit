Or refer to it as dplyr::filter().\n\nmean(mtcars)\n#&gt; Warning in mean.default(mtcars): argument is not numeric or logical: returning\n#&gt; NA\n#&gt; [1] NA\n\nWhat it means: mean() works with numbers and mtcars is a data-frame.\nHow to fix it: if you want the mean of a specific column (say wt), try mean(mtcars$wt).\n\nx &lt;- 2\nif (x = 2) {\n  print(\"x = 2\")\n}\n#&gt; Error in parse(text = input): &lt;text&gt;:2:7: unexpected '='\n#&gt; 1: x &lt;- 2\n#&gt; 2: if (x =\n#&gt;          ^\n\nWhat it means: R doesn’t know what if (x = 2) means!\nHow to fix it: to check if x is 2, use x == 2 rather than x = 2."

Check where you’re running R from with getwd(). You might find it helpful to use RStudio projects to make sure you’re always working in the right place."

If that doesn’t fix it, try searching for the package name on google to see if it’s still on CRAN.\n\nlibrary(rlang)\ninstall.packages(\"rlang\")\n#&gt; Error in install.packages : Updating loaded packages\n\nWhat it means: you’ve tried to install a package that is already in use. This could be because you’ve already loaded it with library(), or it could be a package used by RStudio.\nHow to fix it: try restarting R (Ctrl + Shift + F10 in RStudio) and installing the package in a fresh session. If that doesn’t work, try opening R directly from the start menu and installing the package from there.\n\ninstall.packages(\"xyz\")\n#&gt; Warning in install.packages :\n#&gt;  installation of package ‘xyz’ had non-zero exit status\n\nWhat it means: install.packages() hasn’t worked. This can happen for a few different reasons, like having more than one R session running or trying to install a package from source.\nHow to fix it: try install.packages(\"xyz\", type = \"win.binary\", dependencies = TRUE). If that doesn’t fix it, make sure you don’t have any other R sessions running and try installing in a fresh R session."
