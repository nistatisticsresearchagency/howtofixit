## Duplicated headings in table of contents

If your document has headings appearing more than once in the wrong place, it might be because of an unclosed tag, like a `<div>` that doesn't have a corresponding `</div>`.

This is an example of an RMarkdown document which has a broken table of contents (you can see the HTML output [here](broken_toc.html)):

```{.markdown}
---
title: "Document"
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
---

# Header 1

<div>
text

# Header 2

text
```

This produces a warning message (possibly in the "Background Jobs" tab in RStudio) like this:

```{.bash}
[WARNING] Div at tmp.knit.md line 11 column 1 unclosed at tmp.knit.md line 19 column 1, closing implicitly.
```
